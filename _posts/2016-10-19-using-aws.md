Amazon Web Services (AWS for short) is a cloud platform you can run computations on. It can be used to [host websites](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/wah-linux/web-app-hosting-intro.html), but we will focus on its use for data science. You should [get an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you don't have one already. If you're a student, make sure you also sign up for the [Github student pack](https://education.github.com/pack), it offers $75-$150 of free AWS credits.


AWS doesn't give you direct access to the hardware. Instead, it hosts many [virtual machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) (VM for short) on a single box, allowing Amazon to fully utilize its hardware and serve several customers at once. Amazon calls these VMs "elastic container instances" and serves them via their [Elastic Container 2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2) service.

## To spin up an AWS EC2 instance: 

1. Sign into the AWS console with your Amazon credentials
2. Click on the EC2 link in the upper left corner (under compute)
